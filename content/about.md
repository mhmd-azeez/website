Hi, I’m Muhammad Azeez. I build software, AI automations, and developer tooling that moves the business forward and graduate ideas into reliable products with measurable impact.

## How I create leverage

- **AI & automation:** MCP, multi-agent orchestration, eval loops, and the unglamorous reliability work that keeps assistants useful after launch.
- **Systems & SDKs:** Host SDKs, CLIs, CI/CD, and workflow glue so your platform feels cohesive even when the stack is eclectic.
- **Product-focused engineering:** I’ll take a feature from ideation to deploy, instrument it, and iterate until it buries the spreadsheet goals.

## Impact snapshots

- Took Extism’s host SDKs + CLIs to production across C#, Go, PHP, and TypeScript so customers could embed WebAssembly plugins without a rewrite.
- Helped ship mcp.run + MCP tooling by pairing pragmatic engineering with relentless customer iteration.
- Designed resilient data flows for governments, ed-tech, and SaaS startups: identity, border control, classrooms, billing, payments, analytics.

## Side quests & tinkering

- **olox** — bytecode VM for the Lox language in Odin. [GitHub →](https://github.com/mhmd-azeez/olox)
- **sheets** — a minimalist spreadsheet engine where I play with parsers, dependency graphs, and snapshot tests. [GitHub →](https://github.com/mhmd-azeez/sheets)
- **Wikipedia toolbox** — Lua modules, bots, and SPARQL queries that helped Kurdish editors modernize workflows. [GitHub →](https://github.com/mhmd-azeez/wikipedia)
