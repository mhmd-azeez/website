I'm Muhammad Azeez. I build SDKs, distributed systems, and AI tooling. Most recently at Dylibso shipping WebAssembly infrastructure, and before that spun up an edtech startup scaling to 50k+ students in Iraq.

## What I've built

**Extism SDKs & tooling** — Architected and shipped host SDKs across C#, Go, PHP, and JavaScript, then built the .NET PDK solving WebAssembly integration challenges. Contributed to mcp.run, wiring up AI agents (crewAI, Mastra) with XTP infrastructure. Worked directly with customers on adoption, docs, and troubleshooting.

**Pepu** (co-founder) — Took an education platform from idea to $revenue in Iraq. Engineered a scalable API and data model serving 50,000+ users on a single VPS. Built a billing system (subscriptions, vouchers, offline payments), internal admin portal, and a custom content renderer for rich math/LaTeX that gave us an edge over local competitors.

**Government systems** — [REDACTED]

**Earlier roles** — Fixed memory leaks in desktop apps, spearheaded git adoption + CI/CD pipelines (enabling daily deploys instead of monthly), designed distributed data sync systems, and built an optical mark reader analyzer with custom SkiaSharp layout tools.
