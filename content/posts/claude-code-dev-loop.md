[Grug](https://grugbrain.dev/) brain small. Claude brain also small. This collection of thoughts on using AI coding agents gathered by grug brain developer.

## Grug think of one thing

One user story. One bug. One feature. Not ten thing. Grug brain hold one thing.

## Grug give Claude context

Open Plan Mode. Tell Claude what want. Reference relevant files. Paste official doc for libraries/services. Screenshot if help. Grug not make Claude guess.

## Claude ask. Grug answer.

Claude ask question about design. About edge case. About what mean.

Grug answer honest. Quick.

## Grug read plan. Say yes or no.

Claude suggest approach. If good, say yes. If not, say why. Claude fix. Go back and forth until good.

Not pretend first plan perfect. Grug just say what think.

## Claude work. Grug rest.

Grug say go. Claude go. Grug not help. Grug not interrupt.

## Fresh eyes and test

Ask new Claude to review. Then grug review own self. Grug run code. Grug test. Grug make sure test good.

Grug not trust code that grug not test. Grug make sure new (or existing) automated tests cover new code. Grug ask CC explain new libraries/concepts. Grug make sure grug understand new code.

Grug Profit.
