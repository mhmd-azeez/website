  <p>I was browsing web once when I stumbled upon an article about <a href="https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp">SkiaSharp</a>. It&rsquo;s a C# wrapper around Google&rsquo;s fast 2D rending engine. I was developing desktop apps in WPF at the time and didn&rsquo;t feel the need to learn a low level library like that.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, I found myself in a project that required building a fast layout designer. First, I tried to write it purely in WPF, and I did. It was super slow, on a decently fast computer, it took a few seconds to load a layout.</p>
<p>Then I remembered SkiaSharp. I headed over to its documentation and it seemed easy enough for me to use it. I rewrote the layout engine in SkiaSharp and It was blazing fast. You could have loaded a layout many times in one second and you still wouldn&rsquo;t feel any delay.</p>
<p>So when you see an article about something interesting, even if it&rsquo;s not directly related to what you work on right now, read it. At least skim it. That way when you do need it, you&rsquo;ll at least have a name to google.</p>
<p>I feel like software engineering is not about memorizing every algorithm and data structure out there, but it&rsquo;s about knowing about the right tools for the right problems.</p>
