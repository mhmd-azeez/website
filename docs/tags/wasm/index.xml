      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the early days of computing, software was pretty much locked into specific hardware setups. Then came operating systems, providing a layer of abstraction over the hardware. However, that still didn’t quite cut it. Businesses wanted to write their apps once and have them work on all sorts of platforms. This demand gave birth to higher-level languages that brought along their own runtimes, making it possible for software to run seamlessly on different operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Database UDFs, or user-defined functions, are functions that are created by users to add custom functionality to a database. With UDFs, users can extend the capabilities of a database beyond its built-in functions and tailor it to their specific needs. UDFs are commonly used to perform complex calculations, manipulate data, or perform custom operations that are not natively supported by the database. They help to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written and improve performance by avoiding the need to move data outside of the database.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
